PROJECT TITLE
Explore bikeshare data for three cities


BACKGROUND
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users
to rent	bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also
return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day. Thanks to the rise in information
technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth
of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
To make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Firstly, import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. Lastly, write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.


HOW IT WORKS
Firstly, a prompt to select a city to investigate
Secondly,  users are asked to filter by Month, Day or Both (Month and Day)
Data is presented based on the chosen criteria.
Users can  proceed to see some raw data or return to the beginning


FILES USED
chigaco.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv


DATA SOURCE
Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States
